# Cornell Tech Data Structures and Algorithms 

Below are a few projects I worked on as a student in Cornell Tech's Data Structures and Algorithms course. 

### String Diffing and Respacing Using Dynamic Programming

- [diffing.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/diffing.py)
- [respacing.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/respacing.py)

### Dijkstra's Shortest-Path Algorithm 

We implemented a directed graph using two different data structures:

- [graph_adjacency_list.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/graph_adjacency_list.py)
- [graph_edge_list.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/graph_edge_list.py)

We then implemented Dijkstra's algorithm so that it will work correctly with either graph data structure:

- [shortest_path.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/shortest_path.py)

### Reducing Boolean Expressions to Conjunctive Normal Form

- [sat_solver.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/sat_solver.py)
