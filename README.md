# Cornell Tech Data Structures and Algorithms 

Below are a few projects I worked on as a student in Cornell Tech's Data Structures and Algorithms course. 

### String Diffing and Respacing Using Dynamic Programming

- [diffing.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/diffing.py)
- [respacing.py](https://github.com/barkadosh1/Cornell-Tech-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/respacing.py)

### Dijkstra's Shortest-Path Algorithm 

We implemented a directed graph using two different data structures:

- j
- j

We then implement Dijkstra's algorithm so that it will work correctly with either data graph data structure:

- Code

### Topic 3

- Code
